# üå°Ô∏è Temperature Prediction using Deep Learning (LSTM + Conv1D)

This repository demonstrates a deep learning model for short-term temperature forecasting using time-series data. Refer to `temperature-predictor-lstm-conv1d.ipynb` for more information on model training, metrics, graph plots and more.

A minimal Streamlit interface is included for running predictions on test datasets.

## Project Summary

-   **Objective**: Predict temperature using recent historical readings.
-   **Model**: Bidirectional LSTM + Conv1D hybrid architecture
-   **Performance**:
    -   R¬≤ ‚âà 0.99
    -   RMSE ‚âà 0.68
    -   MAE ‚âà 0.48

## Model Architecture

### Hybrid Conv1D + Bidirectional LSTM

-   **Conv1D layer**
-   **Bidirectional LSTM layers:**
    Process input sequences forwards and backwards, improving sensitivity to complex sequential dynamics in weather data.
-   **Regularization:**
    Normalizing activations helps avoid vanishing/exploding gradients and allowing higher learning rates.
-   **Optimization:**
    Employed **LR_Scheduler** and **Early Stopping** to dynamically adjust learning rate for faster convergence and halt training once validation loss stagnates, avoiding overfitting.

## Core Features

-   Time-based sliding windows to capture recent trends, feeding the model sufficient data for accurate temperature prediction.
-   Cyclical encoding for temporal features (Day, Month)
-   Learning rate scheduling and early stopping
-   Simple Streamlit demo for running inferences on custom inputs, i.e. window-size and steps (for plotting predicted output)

## Training your own model

If you wish to experiment more and train the model on your own, I'd strongly recommend you to use Kaggle.

## Future Improvements

-   **Experiment with Advanced Transformer-based Architectures**
-   **Allow users to fine-tune the model on their own datasets**
